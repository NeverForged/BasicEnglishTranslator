##**Ghost Writer**##
The author *Alexandre Dumas (pere)* was known for his writing collaborations; other authors (notably *August Maquet*) would write the plot and outline, Dumas would fill in the details, add dialogue, etc.

With the large number of scanned books by famous authors one can find at *Project Gutenberg* (<a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/'>gutenberg.org</a>), one could easily have a great author such as *Dumas* do the same for their own outlines, thanks to natural language processing.  Let famous authors fill in the details of, or lend their style to:
        * social media posts
        * plot outlines
        * blog entries
...you name it.

**Research Question:** Can we use NLP and other tools to turn basic plot outlines into stories from famous authors?
      * *Sub Question:* Can we use gensim/nlp to convert a block of text into Basic english?
      * *Sub Question:* Can I use nlp, n-grams, word2vec, etc. to rewrite a simple english block of text in the style of a famous, dead author?
